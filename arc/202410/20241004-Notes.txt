Migrated remaining pages off of tumlbr.
-Claude.ai restyled several pages in a cool retro future style
-Upon closer inspection Claude.ai used an external style sheet
--Style sheet was hosted using a googleapi on a google URL
---I asked Claude to update the coding to remove the external reference
---Google external sheet was only referencing Google URLs
---fonts.google.com has all the fonts free for download
---Created fonts directory at root and downloaded the fonts used
---Fonts were the only reason for the external style sheet
---Lesson learned, make sure any AI style changes are future proof
----Don't rely on external sites or APIs
----Google is great because they love creative destruction
-----Don't let site styling be future collateral damage, just keep it all locally saved
