Worked with ChatGPT 4o to modify the menu to include a submenu. It initially suggested implementing by making a change to styles.css as well as menu.js, but the CSS changes completely screwed up the page formatting. After several failed attempts with CSS, I pulled the Ethan Mollick rule and told it to "Take a deep breath" and think about a way to do it without editing CSS at all. It then gave me a new solution which only required changes to menu.js. It's still not perfectly the way I want it, but I'll back to it tomorrow.
