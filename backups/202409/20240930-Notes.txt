Worked with ChatGPT 4o to modify the menu to include a submenu. 
- 4o initially suggested implementing by making a change to styles.css as well as menu.js, 
--but the CSS changes completely screwed up the page formatting after several attempts. 
--I then followed the Ethan Mollick rule
---I told 4o to "Take a deep breath" and think of a way without modifying the CSS
---For some reason that phrase is quotes makes a big difference (sometimes)
----4o then gave me a new solution which only required changes to menu.js. 
-----It's still not perfectly the way I want it, but I'll come back to it tomorrow.
