Two updates:
(1) bio containers in CSS
(2) hamburger menu revisions
-----
(1) updated site homepage with new bio container
-image and text are now wrapped with a transparent background
-cleaner look
-rounded edges added to image and container
-updated profile image file to 3:4 format and png
-----
(2) inclusion of submenu on hamburger
-initial revision used a span element for the parent item
--sub-items displayed below, it worked on desktop 
--span elemement wasn't clickable on mobile devices
-second iteration, used button element instead of span element
--this changed worked on mobile as well
-also updated hamburger to change color and size when clicked
--highlight colors of the menu selection also adjusted to match change

My collaboration partner today was again ChatGPT 4o

-today I took a slightly different approach
--smaller context windows
-Yesterday it tended to mess up more if a session went too long
-so once it got one element right, like a color change
--I'd start a new session and attach the new files with changes
---Clear memory without thinking about prior session worked better
---break things logically into smaller pieces and the AI does better

This approach has its drawbacks though, if you are using the free
version you may hit the usage limit threshold sooner.

-Mistral

I haven't used mistral much yet for coding, but Claude is very good.
Co-Pilot uses the same engine as ChatGPT
